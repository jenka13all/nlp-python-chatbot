## NLP Python retrieval-based chatbot: presentation on March 6, 2020

This repo contains the slides, code examples and templates for a presentation on NLP basics as applied to a simple project: building a retrieval-style chatbot from scratch with Python using text from the Gutenberg project. The presentation was given on March 6, 2020 to students of the [ReDI School of Digital Integration](linkedin.com/school/redi-school-of-digital-integration/) in Berlin.

Inspiration, respond() function and running robo-chatter thanks to Parul Pandey, "Building a Simple Chatbot from Scratch in Python":
